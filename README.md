# MSc Development Project 2020
Discord Music and Chatbot created for MSc Development Project 2020

# Prerequisites

To run this bot on your local machine, you must have FFMpeg in your PATH.

# Setup, Hosting and Getting the bot into your server.

First you must create a new application on the Discord Developer Portal [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me), and set it as a bot.  [This](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/wiki/Adding-Your-Bot-To-Your-Server) is a simple explanation of how to do so. Then reveal and copy the token of the bot and paste it into the token field in the config.py file.

You will also need a Genius API access key, which you can get [here](https://genius.com/developers).  Create an API application, then copy and paste the Client ID, Client Secret and Access Token into the respective fields in the config.py file.

To install all Python environment requirements:

python setup.py install

Finally:

Run the run.py file from the Python shell.

(Python .\run.py)
